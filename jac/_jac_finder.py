    The source dir comes from one of two places, in order:

    1. A ``jac_linked_source`` marker baked into a linked dev binary
       (``zig build -Ddev`` / ``-Djaclang-dir``; see ``_baked_source_dir``).
       This wins because it is fixed at build time and cwd-independent -- the
       "linked compiler" mode, where the binary ships no bundled ``jaclang``.
    2. Otherwise, ``[dev] jaclang_source`` from the nearest ``jac.toml``::

           [dev]
           jaclang_source = "jac"   # dir CONTAINING jaclang/, relative to jac.toml

       This repo ships it in both the root ``jac.toml`` and ``jac/jac.toml``
       (both pointing at the same source), so the loop holds from the repo root
       AND from ``cd jac`` (where the suite runs); other subprojects opt in by
       adding their own stanza.

    Either way the directory is prepended to the FRONT of ``sys.path`` so
    ``import jaclang`` resolves to the live source instead of the single binary's
    bundled copy -- edits take effect with no rebuild. It runs in
    ``sitecustomize`` during site init, BEFORE the launcher's BOOT_SRC does
    ``import jaclang``, so the override wins over the bundled ``site/`` on
    ``PYTHONPATH``.

    Set ``JAC_NO_DEV_SOURCE=1`` to force the loop OFF even when a source is in
    scope -- used by CI jobs that must exercise the shipped binary's bundled +
    precompiled jaclang rather than the checked-out source tree.

    Caches: sets ``JAC_NO_PRECOMPILE=1`` so the shipped, version-keyed
    ``_precompiled`` JIR bundle is skipped. The per-module ``.jir`` cache is
    content-keyed (``compute_module_key`` folds the source sha256), so source
    edits self-invalidate on their own -- no forced full rebuild needed. Exports
    ``JAC_DEV_SOURCE`` as a marker for tooling (also consumed by
    ``_ext_registry`` to locate the registry inside the linked tree).
