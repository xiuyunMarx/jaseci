# Codebase Orientation for New Contributors

This repository builds the **Jac programming language** -- a Python-superset with a multi-target compiler (Python bytecode, LLVM native, JavaScript), a graph-native runtime, and built-in subsystems for AI, full-stack web, and cloud deployment. If you're looking to contribute, this guide gives you the mental model and the map you need to navigate the codebase.

For setup instructions and PR workflow, see the [Contributing](contributing.md) page.

## Key Concepts

Before you open any files, these five ideas will save you a lot of confusion:

**Jac is written in Jac.** Most of the compiler and runtime are `.jac` files, not Python. A small bootstrap transpiler (`jac0.py`) is pure Python -- it compiles just enough of the compiler infrastructure (`jac0core/`) so the full compiler can take over and compile itself. Once bootstrapped, the full compiler handles everything else. If you're wondering "how does a Jac compiler compile itself?" -- that's the answer.

**Declaration and implementation are separate.** You'll see pairs like `foo.jac` (declarations/interfaces) and `foo.impl.jac` or `impl/foo.impl.jac` (implementations). This is a first-class Jac language feature, similar to header/source separation. When you're looking for where something is *defined*, check the `.jac` file; for how it *works*, check the `.impl.jac` file.

**The unified AST (`unitree`) is central.** All three compilation targets -- Python, native, and JavaScript -- operate on the same AST. A change to the AST potentially affects all backends, so treat `unitree.jac` edits with care.

**The compiler is a pass pipeline.** Compilation is a sequence of passes, each transforming or annotating the AST. The orchestrator in `compiler.jac` defines which passes run and in what order. Understanding which pass does what is the key to working on the compiler.

**Capabilities are built in.** AI (byLLM), serving and deployment (scale), the full-stack client framework, and the MCP server are all part of `jaclang` core, not separate packages. There is no plugin system or entry-point discovery -- features are wired by direct imports, and only their optional third-party dependencies are resolved per-project via `jac install`.

If you're new to Jac syntax, skim the [Syntax Cheatsheet](../quick-guide/syntax-cheatsheet.md) or work through [Jac Fundamentals](../tutorials/language/basics.md) before diving into compiler code. Jac reads like Python in most places, but the declaration/implementation split and some other features will look unfamiliar without that primer.

## Repository Layout

The repo is a **monorepo**; the core language and all first-party subsystems live under `jac/`:

```

## The Core: `jac/jaclang/`

This is the heart of the project -- the compiler, runtime, CLI, and language server. Everything below is relative to `jac/jaclang/`.

### `jac0core/` -- Compiler Infrastructure

This layer defines the data structures and front-end passes that every compilation target depends on. The compiler orchestrator (`compiler.jac`) lives here and controls which passes run and in what order.

The most important files to know:

- **`unitree.jac`** -- The unified AST that all backends share. If you're adding or changing syntax, you'll touch this.
- **`compiler.jac`** -- The pass pipeline orchestrator. It defines schedules like `get_ir_gen_sched()` and `get_py_code_gen()` that chain passes together. This is the authoritative source for pass ordering.
- **`jir.jac` / `jir_registry.jac`** -- The Jac Intermediate Representation and its node type registry. JIR is the serializable form of compiled modules.
- **`diagnostics.jac`** -- Error and warning reporting infrastructure.
- **`modresolver.jac`** -- Module import and dependency resolution.
- **`passes/`** -- Front-end passes: parsing (via Lark grammar), AST validation, symbol table construction, and declaration-implementation matching.
- **`parser/`** -- The Lark grammar definition and lexer that parse Jac source into the initial AST.

### `compiler/` -- Multi-Target Compilation

Jac compiles to **three targets** from the same unified AST:

```
                            ┌─→ Python bytecode  (passes/main/)
Jac Source → unitree AST  ──┼─→ LLVM IR / native (passes/native/)
                            └─→ JavaScript        (passes/ecmascript/)
```

This means a single language change may need updates in up to three backends. The Python target is the default and most mature; the native and JavaScript targets are actively developed.

The `type_system/` directory houses the type inference engine, type compatibility rules, and type operations shared across targets. The `primitives.jac` file defines core type primitives.

A fourth category -- `passes/tool/` -- contains non-compilation passes for the formatter, linter, doc generator, and grammar extractor.

### Compilation Pass Ordering

The compiler orchestrator in `jac0core/compiler.jac` defines several pass schedules. For the default Python target, the full pipeline runs roughly as follows:

**IR generation** (`get_ir_gen_sched`):

1. `ASTValidationPass` -- Validate AST structure after parsing
2. `SymTabBuildPass` -- Build the symbol table (scopes, bindings)
3. `DeclImplMatchPass` -- Pair declarations with their implementations
4. `SemanticAnalysisPass` -- Resolve names, check imports, validate semantics
5. `SemDefMatchPass` -- Link semantic definitions across modules
6. `CFGBuildPass` -- Build control flow graphs for reachability and flow analysis
7. `MTIRGenPass` -- Generate the mid-tier IR used by downstream passes
8. `UniTreeEnrichPass` -- Annotate the AST with computed semantic information

**Type checking** (`get_type_check_sched`, when enabled):

1. `TypeCheckPass` -- Infer and validate types
2. `StaticAnalysisPass` -- Detect unreachable code, unused variables, etc.
3. `UniTreeEnrichPass` -- Final enrichment with type information

**Code generation** (`get_py_code_gen`):

1. `InteropAnalysisPass` -- Analyze Python interop requirements
2. `EsastGenPass` -- Generate JavaScript AST (for JS target)
3. `NaIRGenPass` -- Generate LLVM IR (for native target)
4. `NativeCompilePass` -- JIT-compile LLVM IR to machine code
5. `PyastGenPass` -- Convert the unitree to a Python AST
6. `PyJacAstLinkPass` -- Link the generated Python AST back to Jac source nodes
7. `PyBytecodeGenPass` -- Compile the Python AST to bytecode

See `jac0core/compiler.jac` for the authoritative ordering -- it uses re-entrancy guards during bootstrap that slightly alter the schedule when the compiler is compiling itself.

### `compiler/passes/native/` -- Native Compilation

The native backend generates LLVM IR via `llvmlite`. The main pass (`na_ir_gen_pass.jac`) delegates to implementation files in `na_ir_gen_pass.impl/`, each handling a different part of the language:

| File | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `core.impl.jac` | Module setup, entry points, target triple configuration |
| `stmt.impl.jac` | Statements -- if/else, for/while loops, assignments, returns |
| `expr.impl.jac` | Expressions -- binary/unary ops, comparisons, attribute access |
| `func.impl.jac` | Function definitions, closures, parameter handling |
| `calls.impl.jac` | Function call codegen, argument passing |
| `objects.impl.jac` | Class/struct layout, field access, inheritance chains |
| `types.impl.jac` | Mapping Jac types to LLVM types (i64, double, pointers, etc.) |
| `comprehensions.impl.jac` | List, dict, and set comprehension codegen |
| `builtins.impl.jac` | Builtin function implementations (print, len, range, etc.) |
| `lists.impl.jac`, `dicts.impl.jac`, `sets.impl.jac`, `tuples.impl.jac` | Collection type operations |
| `vtable.impl.jac` | Virtual method dispatch tables for dynamic dispatch |
| `refcount.impl.jac` | Reference counting for memory management |
| `exceptions.impl.jac` | Try/catch/finally, exception propagation |

### `cli/` -- Command-Line Interface

The CLI is organized as a command abstraction in `command.jac` with command groups (`execution`, `build`, `project`, `analysis`, `config`, ...) each in their own module under `commands/`. The core execution logic -- how `jac run` actually invokes the compiler and runs the result -- lives in `impl/execution.impl.jac`.

### `runtimelib/` -- Runtime Library

This is what Jac programs depend on at execution time. The key modules:

- **`builtin.jac`** -- Builtin functions and types available in every Jac program.
- **`memory.jac`** -- Memory management, including the shelved object store for graph persistence.
- **`server.jac`** -- FastAPI-based HTTP server used by `jac start` to serve walkers as API endpoints.
- **`context.jac`** -- Execution context -- tracks the current graph root, walker state, and runtime configuration.
- **`scheduler.jac`** -- Async task scheduling for concurrent walker execution.
- **`testing.jac`** -- Test runner integration backing `jac test`.
- **`hmr.jac`** -- Hot module reloading -- watches `.jac` files and recompiles on change during development.

### `lsp/` and `langserve/`

These two modules power IDE support. `lsp/` implements the Language Server Protocol (completions, diagnostics, go-to-definition, hover). `langserve/` is the engine underneath -- it manages open modules, coordinates incremental recompilation, and feeds semantic data to the LSP layer. If you're working on IDE features, you'll usually start in `lsp/` for the protocol handling and drop into `langserve/` for the semantic logic.

### `project/`

Handles `jac.toml` configuration parsing, dependency resolution, capability configuration, and project scaffolding templates.

## Built-in Subsystems

Features that once shipped as separate plugin packages now live inside `jaclang` core and are called directly. There is no plugin system, no entry-point discovery, and no external plugin support -- see [Plugins (Removed)](../reference/plugin-authoring.md) for the removal details. What each subsystem adds, and where it lives:

| Subsystem | What it adds |
|--------|-------------|
| `byllm` (`jac/jaclang/byllm/`) | LLM-powered functions -- annotate a function signature with a docstring and byLLM calls an LLM to implement it at runtime. `litellm` and other model deps are optional, pulled per-project via `[byllm]` config + `jac install`. |
| `scale` (`jac/jaclang/scale/`) | Cloud deployment -- wraps `jac start` with FastAPI, adds Kubernetes deployment, Docker builds, MongoDB/Redis storage backends. Its optional deps are pulled per-project via `[scale.*]` config + `jac install`. |
| client framework (`jac/jaclang/runtimelib/client/`) | Full-stack web, desktop, and mobile -- compiles `.cl.jac` to JavaScript, bundles with Vite, and hosts desktop webview apps. |
| MCP server (`jac/jaclang/cli/mcp/`) | `jac mcp` -- exposes the live Jac compiler and project to AI coding assistants. See the [MCP reference](../reference/mcp.md). |

## Tests

Tests are organized in a parallel directory structure under `jac/tests/`, mirroring the source layout:

```
tests/
├── compiler/          # Compiler pass tests
│   └── passes/        # Tests for individual passes
├── language/          # Language feature tests (fixture-based)
├── runtimelib/        # Runtime library tests
├── langserve/         # Language server tests
├── project/           # Project system tests
├── utils/             # Utility tests
└── fixtures_list.jac  # Registry of all test fixtures
```

**Running tests:**

```bash
# All tests (parallel)
pytest jac -n auto

# Specific area
pytest jac/tests/compiler -n auto
pytest jac/tests/language -n auto

# Single test file
pytest jac/tests/compiler/passes/test_type_checker.py -v
```

Many language tests use **fixture files** -- small `.jac` programs in `fixtures/` directories that exercise specific features. The `fixtures_list.jac` file registers them. When you add a new language feature or fix a bug, adding a fixture test is usually the right move.

## Documentation

The docs use [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and live in `docs/`:

```
docs/
├── mkdocs.yml              # Site configuration and navigation
├── docs/
│   ├── quick-guide/        # Getting-started content
│   ├── reference/          # Comprehensive language & API reference
│   ├── tutorials/          # Step-by-step learning content
│   └── community/          # Contributor resources, release notes
└── scripts/                # Doc generation and build scripts
```

There are three documentation tiers with different contributor expectations:

1. **Quick Guide** -- First experience with Jac. Most features don't need to touch this.
2. **Full Reference** -- Must cover everything. **Every feature or change should update the reference docs.**
3. **Tutorials** -- Hands-on learning guides for specific workflows.

**Building docs locally:**

```bash
pip install -e docs
python docs/scripts/mkdocs_serve.py
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | What it does |
|----------|---------------|
| `ci.yml` | All PR/push checks: builds the `jac` binary once, then fans out the full test suite, client/scale jobs, lint + format enforcement, docs validation, contribution checks, and the installer/k8s e2e jobs (path-gated) |
| `release.yml` | The release lifecycle: version-bump PRs, and on merge the tag + GitHub Release + binary publish (human-approved) |
| `build-binaries.yml` | Builds the per-platform native `jac` binaries and attaches them to a release |
| `release-dev.yml` | Rolling `dev` prerelease binaries on every push to main |
| `nightly.yml` | Cron canaries: notes-app CEF smoke and the live-release installer check |
| `deploy-docs.yml` | Deploy docs site to production |

Pre-commit hooks run formatting and linting on every commit locally. See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for the full hook list.
