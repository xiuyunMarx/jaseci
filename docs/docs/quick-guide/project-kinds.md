# What You Can Build

Jac compiles one language to three runtimes -- Python bytecode (server, `sv`), JavaScript (client, `cl`), and native machine code (`na`, which also compiles to in-browser WebAssembly) -- so the *same* skills produce a CLI tool, a REST API, a full-stack app, a desktop/mobile build, native compute that runs in the browser, or a C-callable shared library. This page is a cookbook: a **small, working example of each common thing you can build** with Jac today, plus the verbs that build and run it. Each one is a *combination* of a few building blocks, not a separate mode.

Every example below was run against the current toolchain. Install once and follow along:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the self-contained `jac` binary -- no Python, pip, or uv required.

!!! tip "`jac run` is kind-aware"
    Set `kind` under `[project]` in `jac.toml` (or let it be inferred from the entry-point's codespace), and a bare `jac run` does the right thing for that kind: **execute** runnable kinds (`cli`, `cli-native`), **serve** server kinds (`service`, `web-app`, ...), or **build** artifact kinds (`native-binary`, `native-lib`, `py-package`, `js-package`). `jac run --show` prints the resolved plan and the equivalent primitive command without running it. The explicit verbs shown in each recipe below are those primitives.

## The recipes at a glance

Jac gives you three runtime targets -- server (`sv`), client (`cl`), and native (`na`) -- plus a few ways to **serve**, **package**, or wrap them in a **shell**. Everything below is a *combination* of those building blocks, not a separate mode. The grid shows which blocks each recipe uses; each recipe's exact command is in its section below.

Jac is also batteries-included -- it bundles LLVM, ships its own native linker, runs its own server, and auto-installs the JS runtime (`bun`) on demand. The only recipes needing an external toolchain are the ones wrapping a native OS shell, called out in the last column.

Each recipe name links to its guided **"I like to build…" track** -- a 5-minute quick win plus a curated path through the tutorials and reference. The detailed inline recipe for each is in the sections further down this page.

**Legend** -- ● uses this block · ◐ talks to a *remote* server (doesn't bundle one) · ×N replicated per service. **status**: ✅ shipping · 🧪 beta (works, with caveats footnoted below) · 🚧 not yet wired end-to-end ([see roadmap](#on-the-roadmap)). Columns 2–7 are *composition* (what it's made of): **sv / cl / na** = which runtimes compile (`na` to a host binary, or to WebAssembly for [in-browser native](#in-browser-native-wasm)) · **served** = hosted by `jac start` (exposing any `sv` walkers/functions as a REST API) · **packaged** = produces a distributable artifact · **shell** = wrapped in a native desktop/mobile shell. The **requires** column is a different axis -- *setup cost*: toolchains you install yourself, excluding the built-in `scale` subsystem (which ships with `jaclang` core; its optional deploy deps are pulled per-project via `[scale.*]` config + `jac install`) and the full-stack client/desktop framework (which also ships with `jaclang` core).

<small>¹ Only to *upload* to PyPI; `jac bundle` itself needs nothing. &nbsp; ² The desktop target ships with `jaclang` core (no Rust); it embeds the OS webview. On Linux you need the WebKitGTK system libraries (a bundled helper script installs them). &nbsp; ³ Only to *publish* (`npm publish`); `jac bundle` builds the `.tgz` with no Node/npm. &nbsp; ⁴ The binary renders your `cl` UI today; wiring `sv` walkers onto the embedded interpreter, HMR dev mode, and per-OS installers are in progress ([#6436](https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/issues/6436)). &nbsp; ⁵ Frontend-only Capacitor wrapper -- the app talks to a Jac server you deploy separately. &nbsp; ⁶ Beta React Native (Expo/Metro) frontend built from a mobUI source tree (`@jac/mobui` primitives, no HTML) that also compiles for the web; it talks to a Jac server you deploy separately.</small>

Read across a row and the composition is the point: a full-stack app is just a *service* plus a *client*; in-browser native swaps the server for an `na` module compiled to wasm; a desktop app is a full-stack app plus a *shell*; microservices are a *service* replicated. The 🚧 rows aren't missing "kinds" -- they're capability combinations that aren't wired yet.

## Backend & CLI

### CLI tool

The simplest project: anything you run straight from the terminal -- scripts, automation, dev tools. A `.jac` file runs directly with the whole language and ecosystem available (it just needs Jac installed; to ship a self-contained binary instead, see [Native binary](#native-binary)). Jac is graph-native, so even a one-off script can model data as nodes and traverse them with a walker.

```jac
# hello.jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
}

walker Greeter {
    can start with Root entry {
        visit [-->];
    }
    can greet with Person entry {
        print(f"Hello, {here.name}!");
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    root ++> Person(name="Ada");
    root ++> Person(name="Alan");
    root spawn Greeter();
}
```

```bash
jac run hello.jac
```

```text
Hello, Ada!
Hello, Alan!
```

!!! tip "`root` persists"
    The graph hanging off `root` is automatically saved between runs. Run it twice and you'll see the people accumulate -- that persistence is the same machinery that backs Jac servers, with no database to set up.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full tutorial: [Jac Fundamentals](../tutorials/language/basics.md) · [Graphs & Walkers](../tutorials/language/osp.md)

### Native binary

A `.na.jac` file compiles, through LLVM, to a **standalone, zero-dependency executable** you can ship to machines that have neither Jac nor Python installed -- like a `curl`-style single-binary tool. (Same command-line territory as a [CLI tool](#cli-tool), but the trade is reversed: ship-anywhere portability in exchange for the restricted native subset.) That subset requires a `with entry` block and allows no walkers/nodes/async and no Python imports.

```jac
# sum.na.jac
def compute_sum(n: int) -> int {
    total: int = 0;
    i: int = 1;
    while i <= n {
        total = total + i;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return total;
}

with entry {
    result = compute_sum(10);
    print(f"Sum of 1 to 10: {result}");
}
```

```bash
jac nacompile sum.na.jac -o sum
./sum
```

```text
Sum of 1 to 10: 55
```

The result is a real native binary (a few KB here) you can ship without Python or Jac installed.

### API service

A server with no frontend. Mark a walker `walker:pub` (or a function `def:pub`) and it becomes a REST endpoint automatically -- request bodies map onto the walker's `has` fields, and `report` becomes the JSON response.

```jac
# api.jac
node Task {
    has title: str;
    has done: bool = False;
}

walker:pub add_task {
    has title: str;
    can create with Root entry {
        task = Task(title=self.title);
        root ++> task;
        report {"id": jid(task), "title": task.title};
    }
}

walker:pub list_tasks {
    can fetch with Root entry {
        report [{"id": jid(t), "title": t.title, "done": t.done}
                for t in [-->][?:Task]];
    }
}
```

```bash
jac start api.jac --no-client
```

`--no-client` skips all frontend bundling -- a pure JSON API. Walkers are exposed at `POST /walker/<name>`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/walker/add_task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Write docs"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/walker/list_tasks
```

Interactive API docs are served at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger) and a live graph view at `http://localhost:8000/graph`.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full tutorial: [Local API Server](../tutorials/production/local.md)

### Microservices

The same code runs as a monolith *or* as several independently-deployed services -- the only change is the `sv import` keyword. When both modules are server-context, the compiler turns the import into an HTTP client stub: calls become RPCs, but the source still reads like a normal import.

```jac
# math_service.jac  (the provider)
def:pub add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b;
}

def:pub multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a * b;
}
```

```jac
# calculator_service.jac  (the consumer)
sv import from math_service { add, multiply }

def:pub dot_product(a: list[int], b: list[int]) -> int {
    result = 0;
    for i in range(len(a)) {
        result = add(result, multiply(a[i], b[i]));  # each call is a POST over HTTP
    }
    return result;
}
```

With a `jac.toml` in the directory, one command brings up the whole cluster -- the consumer auto-starts every service it imports from:

```bash
jac start calculator_service.jac --port 8002

curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/function/dot_product \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"a": [1,2,3], "b": [4,5,6]}'
```

To split services across hosts, point each consumer at its providers with `JAC_SV_<MODULE>_URL` environment variables -- no source change. `jac setup microservice --add <file>` records which files become services for production deploys.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full tutorial: [Microservices with `sv import`](../tutorials/production/microservices.md)

### Python package (PyPI)

A reusable library -- no entry point -- packaged as a standard pip wheel. Any `def:pub` is part of the public API.

```jac
# greetlib.jac
def:pub greet(name: str) -> str {
    return f"Hello, {name}!";
}
```

```toml
# jac.toml
[project]
name = "greetlib"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A tiny Jac library"
```

```bash
jac bundle
# → dist/greetlib-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Upload it with `twine`, then `pip install greetlib` anywhere. The wheel ships your compiled modules and runs under the `jac` binary -- it does not list `jaclang` as a runtime dependency.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Reference: [Publishing](../reference/publishing.md)

### npm package

The client-side counterpart to the Python package: a `cl` component (or function) library published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) so any JavaScript or TypeScript project can `npm install` it -- whether or not they use Jac. The same `jac.toml` drives it; `--target npm` compiles your client modules to ES-module JavaScript, generates `package.json`, and emits `.d.ts` TypeScript declarations.

```jac
# greetui/index.cl.jac
def:pub Greeting(name: str) -> JsxElement {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

```toml
# jac.toml
[project]
name = "greetui"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A tiny Jac component library"

[project.include]
packages = ["greetui"]

[npm]
name = "@myscope/greetui"   # optional scoped npm name
```

```bash
jac bundle --target npm
# → dist/myscope-greetui-0.1.0.tgz   (jac bundle --target all builds the wheel too)
```

The generated `package.json` wires in `@jaseci/runtime` automatically for JSX/reactive code. Upload it with `npm publish` (Jac builds the tarball but doesn't upload, exactly like `twine` for wheels).

!!! note "npm packages must be standalone client code"
    A module that crosses a server boundary (an `sv` import or call) can't run from a plain `npm install`, so `jac bundle --target npm` rejects it with a clear error. Keep server-coupled code in your app, not in the published library.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Reference: [Publishing to npm](../reference/publishing.md#publishing-to-npm-npmjsorg)

### Shared library (C ABI)

The native counterpart to the [Python](#python-package-pypi) and [npm](#npm-package) packages: an `na` module compiled to a **C-ABI shared library** (`.so` / `.dylib` / `.dll`) that *any* language with a C FFI -- C, C++, Rust, Go (`cgo`), Python (`ctypes`) -- can link or `dlopen`. It's the mirror image of `import from "lib.so"` (calling C *from* Jac): here you expose Jac *to* C. Like the other packages it has no entry point; the public surface is whatever you mark `:pub`.

```jac
# mathlib.na.jac
glob:pub counter: int = 7;                  # exported global

def:pub jadd(a: int, b: int) -> int {       # exported function
    return a + b;
}

obj:pub Point {
    has x: int = 0, y: int = 0;
}

def:pub make_point(x: int, y: int) -> Point { return Point(x=x, y=y); }
def:pub point_sum(p: Point) -> int { return p.x + p.y; }
```

```bash
jac nacompile mathlib.na.jac --shared                    # → ./libmathlib.so
jac nacompile mathlib.na.jac --shared --target macos     # → ./libmathlib.dylib
jac nacompile mathlib.na.jac --shared --target windows   # → ./libmathlib.dll
```

Load it like any other shared library -- here from Python via `ctypes`:

```python
import ctypes
lib = ctypes.CDLL("./libmathlib.so")
lib.jadd.restype = ctypes.c_int64
lib.jadd.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int64, ctypes.c_int64]
print(lib.jadd(2, 3))   # 5
```

Scalars pass by value; Jac objects and strings cross as opaque handles (a `void*` you hand back to the library), with exported `jac_retain`/`jac_release` to manage their reference-counted lifetime, and module globals initialize automatically on load. Same batteries-included story as the rest -- Jac's own linker emits the ELF/Mach-O/PE file, so there's no `gcc`, `ld`, or `lld` in the loop (and the `--target` cross-builds need no extra toolchain either).

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Reference: [Native pathway -- Shared libraries](../reference/language/native-pathway.md#shared-libraries-c-abi)

## Full-stack & apps

### Full-stack app

The headline case: backend, frontend, and data model in **one file**. Code in a `cl` block (or `.cl.jac` file) compiles to a React/JSX bundle for the browser; everything else compiles to Python for the server. The compiler generates the HTTP calls between them -- `await add_todo(...)` in the client is a real RPC to the server function, with types shared across the boundary.

```jac
# main.jac
node Todo {
    has title: str, done: bool = False;
}

def:pub add_todo(title: str) -> Todo {
    todo = Todo(title=title);
    root ++> todo;
    return todo;
}

def:pub get_todos -> list[Todo] {
    return [root-->][?:Todo];
}

cl def:pub app -> JsxElement {
    has todos: list[Todo] = [], text: str = "";
    async can with entry { todos = await get_todos(); }
    async def add {
        if text.strip() {
            todos = todos + [await add_todo(text.strip())];
            text = "";
        }
    }
    return <div>
        <input value={text}
            onChange={lambda e: ChangeEvent { text = e.target.value; }}
            placeholder="Add a todo..." />
        <button onClick={add}>Add</button>
        {[<p key={jid(t)}>{t.title}</p> for t in todos]}
    </div>;
}
```

```toml
# jac.toml
[project]
name = "mini-todo"

[dependencies.npm]
react = "^18.2.0"
react-dom = "^18.2.0"

[dependencies.npm.dev]
vite = "^6.4.1"
"@vitejs/plugin-react" = "^4.2.1"
typescript = "^5.3.3"
"@types/react" = "^18.2.0"
"@types/react-dom" = "^18.2.0"

[serve]
base_route_app = "app"

[plugins.client]
```

```bash
jac start          # production server
jac start --dev    # hot-module reload while you edit
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). No database, no separate frontend project, no glue code.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full tutorial: [Full-Stack Project Setup](../tutorials/fullstack/setup.md)

### In-browser native (wasm)

The `na` runtime's other target: rather than a host binary, an `na {}` block compiles to **WebAssembly** and runs *in the browser*, driven by a `cl` page -- native-speed compute (a game loop, a simulation, a hot inner loop) executing client-side with no server round-trip. It's the mirror image of a [full-stack app](#full-stack-app): there the heavy lifting runs on the server (`sv`); here it runs in the browser (`na` -> wasm). The block's `import from ...` externs become the wasm module's *imports*, satisfied from JavaScript -- the same native source contract as a [native binary](#native-binary), fulfilled by a different host.

One module holds both halves:

```jac
# main.jac
na {
    """Count primes below n -- a tight integer loop, compiled to WebAssembly."""
    def count_primes(n: int) -> int {
        count = 0;
        i = 2;
        while i < n {
            is_prime = True;
            j = 2;
            while j < i {
                if i % j == 0 { is_prime = False; break; }
                j += 1;
            }
            if is_prime { count += 1; }
            i += 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

cl {
    def:pub app -> JsxElement {
        has answer: str = "computing...";
        async can with entry {
            res: any = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
                fetch("/static/main.wasm"), {"env": {"puts": lambda { return 0; }}}
            );
            wasm: any = res.instance.exports;
            wasm.__jac_glob_init();
            # an i64 crosses the JS boundary as a BigInt; format it straight to text
            answer = f"{wasm.count_primes(BigInt(20000))}";
        }
        return <div>
            <h1>Native compute in the browser</h1>
            <p>{"primes below 20000 (computed in wasm): "}<b>{answer}</b></p>
        </div>;
    }
}
```

It uses the same `jac.toml` as the [full-stack app](#full-stack-app) (React deps + `[plugins.client]`).

Set `kind = "web-static"` in `jac.toml` so the toolchain treats it as a client-only app (no backend):

```bash
jac start          # builds the cl bundle + na->wasm, serves on http://localhost:8000
jac start --dev    # same, with hot reload
jac build          # portable, self-contained dist in .jac/client/dist/
```

Because a `client` project has no server, `jac start` serves the build with a **minimal static server** (no API server, auth, or database) and `jac build` emits a **portable `index.html`** with its JS/CSS inlined, so a pure `cl` page opens directly from disk (`file://`). An app that fetches `/static/main.wasm` at runtime, like this one, must be *served* (the browser can't fetch the module over `file://`). See [Client-only apps](../reference/plugins/jac-client.md#client-only-apps).

`jac start` compiles the `na` block to `/static/main.wasm` as part of the client build -- no emscripten and no `wasm-ld`; Jac's own WebAssembly linker turns the object into an instantiable module -- and the page fetches it on mount. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```text
primes below 20000 (computed in wasm): 2262
```

!!! note "The boundary is the raw wasm ABI"
    A `cl` page drives the module through the WebAssembly interface directly -- `instantiateStreaming`, `exports`, and C-ABI value marshalling (an `int` / `i64` arrives in JavaScript as a `BigInt`). Wrapping that glue in a reusable `.cl.jac` keeps the page clean: the full example below does exactly this with a WebGL shim that fulfills a graphics module's `import from raylib` externs in the browser.

### Desktop app

Wrap the *same* full-stack app in a native desktop window. Jac compiles your `cl`
UI into **one `jac nacompile`d binary that embeds the OS webview** (WebKitGTK /
WKWebView / WebView2) - no Rust toolchain, no PyInstaller, no separate process.

The `desktop` target ships with `jaclang` core -- no separate install or setup step.

```bash
jac build --client desktop            # -> .jac/client/desktop/<app>  (single binary)
jac start --client desktop            # build + launch the native window
```

Window title and size are configured under `[plugins.desktop]` in `jac.toml`.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full tutorial: [Desktop App](../tutorials/fullstack/desktop.md)

### Mobile app (webview)

Ship the same client bundle to Android/iOS via **Capacitor**, which wraps it in a native webview. The mobile app is the *frontend only* -- it talks to your Jac server over HTTP, so deploy the backend separately (e.g. as an [API service](#api-service)).

```bash
# prerequisites: Android: JDK + Android SDK; iOS (macOS): Xcode (no Node.js -- JS tooling runs on the bundled Bun)
jac setup mobile --platform android    # one-time scaffold (android/)

jac start main.jac --client mobile --dev          # live reload on device/emulator
jac build --client mobile --platform android      # → android/.../app-debug.apk
```

Use `--platform ios` on macOS to produce an Xcode project. App name and id are set under `[plugins.client.mobile]`.

:octicons-arrow-right-24: Full tutorial: [Mobile App](../tutorials/fullstack/mobile.md)

### Mobile app (React Native)

Ship a **true native** mobile app (Android + iOS) using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), with platform-native views rather than a webview. This is the *frontend only* -- it talks to your Jac server over HTTP, so deploy the backend separately (e.g. as an [API service](#api-service)).

A React Native app is a **mobUI** project: one source tree that compiles to both web (via `react-native-web`) and native (Android/iOS via Metro). Instead of HTML tags, mobUI projects use Jac's `@jac/mobui` component vocabulary (`View`, `Text`, `Pressable`, `TextInput`, `Image`, `ScrollView`), which projects to every target. Raw HTML tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, ...) are compile errors in a mobUI project -- see [`E1105`](../reference/diagnostics.md#mobui-project-jsx-host-tags).

```bash
# prerequisites: Android: JDK + Android SDK; iOS (macOS): Xcode (no Node.js -- JS tooling runs on the bundled Bun)
jac setup react-native              # one-time scaffold (.jac/mobile-rn/)

jac start main.jac --client react-native --dev   # Fast Refresh on device/emulator
jac build --client react-native --platform android
jac build --client react-native --platform ios    # macOS only
```

Set `client_kind = "mobui"` under `[project]` in `jac.toml` to opt in. The scaffold and build options live under `[plugins.client.react_native]`.

## On the roadmap

These aren't missing "kinds" -- they're **capability combinations that aren't wired end-to-end yet**. Here's the honest status and the closest thing you can do today.

- **Full-stack package** (`sv` + `cl` + *attach*) -- An installable feature that brings its own routes, UI components, and data models into your app (think "drop in payments and get a checkout button + endpoints + models"). `sv import` composes *services* over HTTP, but there's no attachable in-process package yet. This needs a no-entry "package" artifact and conflict-resolution semantics across the three runtimes.

!!! info "Want to follow the design?"
    The unified build/artifact work that would close these gaps is tracked in the Jac repo's `jac build` / `.jab` proposals.
