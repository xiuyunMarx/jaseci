??? "Getting Started & Setup"

    ??? question "I updated to the latest Jac toolchain and my project won't `jac start` properly."
        Run `jac purge` to clear the global bytecode cache. This is the recommended approach after upgrading packages:
        ```bash
        jac purge
        ```

        This command works even when the cache is corrupted. If `jac purge` is not available (older versions), manually clear the cache:
        ```
        Linux:   rm -rf ~/.cache/jac/bytecode/
        macOS:   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/jac/bytecode/
        Windows: rmdir /s /q %LOCALAPPDATA%\jac\cache\bytecode
        ```

    ??? question "What do I need to install to get started with Jac?"
        See the [Installation Guide](https://docs.jaseci.org/quick-guide/install/)

    ??? question "What are good first projects to build with Jac?"
        Check out the [AI Day Planner Tutorial](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/first-app/build-ai-day-planner/)

??? "Language & Concepts"

    ??? question "What's the difference between Jac, Jaclang, and Jaseci?"
        - Jac: The language
        - Jaclang: The compiler/runtime, shipped as the self-contained `jac` binary
        - Jaseci: The broader framework and ecosystem. All core capabilities -- `scale` for serving and deployment, byLLM for AI, the full-stack client framework, and the MCP server -- ship built into the `jac` binary; only their optional third-party dependencies are pulled per-project via `jac install`

    ??? question "Do I need to know graph theory to use Jaseci?"
        No. Learn OSP: [OSP Guide](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/language/osp/)

    ??? question "Can I use Python libraries (PyPI) in Jac?"
        Yes. Jac integrates seamlessly with Python libraries.

    ??? question "What's the learning curve coming from Python? How is Jac different from just using Python?"
        Jac compiles to Python bytecode and shares familiar syntax -- you'll feel at home. Key differences:

        - Braces `{ }` instead of indentation
        - Semicolons `;` required
        - Type annotations encouraged
        - New keywords: `node`, `edge`, `walker`, `has`, `can`

        Start here: [Jac Basics](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/language/basics/)

    ??? question "I'm coming from JavaScript/TypeScript -- what should I know?"
        Jac's frontend syntax will look familiar (JSX-style):

        - Braces and semicolons (same as JS)
        - JSX for components
        - React-like patterns (`useState`, `useEffect`)

        What's different:

        - Python-based syntax for logic
        - No `const`/`let` -- just variable assignment
        - Type annotations use `:` not TypeScript syntax

        Start here: [Full-Stack Setup](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/fullstack/setup/)

    ??? question "I'm new to programming / coming from another language -- where do I start?"
        Key concepts to learn:

        1. **Python ecosystem** -- Jac uses Python libraries
        2. **Graph thinking** -- Model data as nodes and edges
        3. **Walker pattern** -- Computation that moves through data

        Start here: [Installation](https://docs.jaseci.org/quick-guide/install/) → [Build an AI Day Planner](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/first-app/build-ai-day-planner/)

    ??? question "Can ____ be done in Jac? Is ____ compatible with Jac?"
        **Yes**, if the answer to any of these questions is yes:

        - Can it be done in Python with any PyPI package?
        - Can it be done in TypeScript/JavaScript with any Node.js package?
        - Can it be done in C with any C-compatible library?

        Jac compiles to Python (server), JavaScript (client), and native binaries (C ABI), so any library or tool compatible with those ecosystems is compatible with Jac.

        **If you find something that works in Python/Node.js/C but doesn't work in Jac, that's a bug!** Please [file an issue](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci/issues) or let us know in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6j3QNdtcN6).

??? "AI & LLM Integration"

    ??? question "How does byLLM differ from calling OpenAI/Anthropic directly?"
        - Standardized interface across AI providers
        - Integrated model management in Jac
        - Simplified prompt engineering
        See [API key setup](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/first-app/build-ai-day-planner/#part-5-making-it-smart-with-ai)

    ??? question "How do I structure by llm() functions so that the output is deterministic and parseable?"
        Use structured prompts and response templates. [byLLM Reference](https://docs.jaseci.org/reference/plugins/byllm/)

??? "Production & Deployment"

    ??? question "How do I deploy a Jac app to production?"
        - [Local Deployment](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/production/local/): `jac start` creates an HTTP API server.
        - [Kubernetes Deployment](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/production/kubernetes/): Deploy with a single command.

    ??? question "Do I need Docker/Kubernetes knowledge to deploy with scale?"
        No. Scale (built into `jaclang`) handles containerization and orchestration automatically.

    ??? question "What does scale do automatically?"
        - Containerizes Jac application
        - Sets up Kubernetes deployment
        - Manages scaling and load balancing
        [Kubernetes Deployment Reference](https://docs.jaseci.org/tutorials/production/kubernetes/)

??? "Common Issues"

    ??? question "I installed Jac with the one-line installer but `pip show` says packages aren't installed."
        The one-line installer downloads the self-contained native `jac` binary -- it does not install anything into a Python environment, so `pip show` and `pip list` have nothing to find. Use `jac --version` to confirm the installed version.

    ??? question "`jac clean --all` says 'No jac.toml found'."
        `jac clean --all` (and the project-level cleanup flags it implies) needs a Jac project -- a directory with a `jac.toml`. Plain `jac clean` (no flags) only clears the local `.jac/data/` directory, but `--all`, `--cache`, and `--packages` operate on project artifacts and require the project root. If you're running standalone `.jac` scripts outside a project, delete the data directory manually: `rm -rf .jac/`. To create a project, run `jac create <name>`.

    ??? question "I see 'Address already in use' when running `jac start`."
        Another process is using the port (default 8000). Either stop the other process or use a different port: `jac start --port 3000`.

    ??? question "My frontend shows data but fields are empty or undefined."
        When returning node objects directly from `def:pub` endpoints, use `jid(node)` to access the node's unique identity. For reliable client-side access, return explicit dictionaries from your endpoints:
        <!-- jac-skip -->
        ```jac
        # Instead of: return task;
        # Use:
        return {"id": jid(task), "title": task.title, "done": task.done};
        ```

    ??? question "`jac create --use web-static` fails or asks about Bun."
        The `--use web-static` template requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) for frontend bundling. If Bun isn't installed, `jac create` will offer to install it automatically. You can also install it manually: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.
