# Configuration Reference

The `jac.toml` file is the central configuration for Jac projects -- similar to `pyproject.toml` in Python or `package.json` in Node.js. It defines project metadata (name, version, entry point), manages dependencies (both PyPI and npm packages), sets defaults for CLI commands (test verbosity, server port, lint rules), configures built-in capabilities (LLM models, deployment targets), and supports environment-specific profiles (development vs. production).

You typically don't need to edit `jac.toml` manually for basic projects. The `jac create` command generates one with sensible defaults, and commands like `jac add` and `jac config set` modify it for you. But understanding the full configuration surface is valuable when you need to customize build behavior, configure LLM providers, set up lint rules, or manage deployment settings.

`jac` commands locate `jac.toml` by walking up from the current working directory. The only exception is `jac install -e <path>`, which reads `jac.toml` from the resolved `<path>` so editable installs work from anywhere.

## Creating a Project

```bash
# Basic project
jac create myapp
cd myapp

# Full-stack web app (recommended for web development)
jac create myapp --use web-static
cd myapp
```

This creates a `jac.toml` with default settings. When using `--use web-static`, the scaffolded project includes:

```
myapp/
├── main.jac                  # Entry point with the client app
├── jac.toml                  # Project configuration (auto-generated)
├── components/
│   └── Button.cl.jac         # Example client component
├── assets/                   # Static assets
├── README.md
├── AGENTS.md                 # Points AI coding agents at `jac guide`
└── .gitignore
```

The auto-generated `jac.toml` for a `--use web-static` project looks like:

```toml
[project]
name = "myapp"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Jac client application: myapp"
entry-point = "main.jac"

[dependencies.npm]
jac-client-node = "1.0.7"

[serve]
base_route_app = "app"

[client]
```

You typically don't need to modify this file until you add dependencies or customize settings.

## Configuration Sections

### [project]

Project metadata. Runtime fields (`entry-point`, `jac-version`) are used by `jac run` and `jac start`. Publishing fields (`license`, `readme`, `keywords`, `requires-python`, `authors`, `maintainers`, and `[project.include]`) are used by `jac build --as wheel` when building a distributable wheel. All publishing fields are optional -- a project that is never published only needs `name`.

```toml
[project]
name = "myapp"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "My Jac application"
entry-point = "main.jac"
kind = "service"   # drives `jac run` (omit to infer from the entry-point)
jac-version = ">=0.15.0"

# Publishing metadata -- only needed to run `jac build --as wheel`
license = "MIT"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
keywords = ["jac", "ai"]
authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com" }]
maintainers = [{ name = "Another Person", email = "them@example.com" }]

[project.urls]
homepage = "https://example.com"
repository = "https://github.com/user/repo"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Project / PyPI package name (required) |
| `version` | string | Semantic version (default: `0.1.0`) |
| `description` | string | One-line summary (also shown on PyPI) |
| `entry-point` | string | Main file for `jac run` (default: `main.jac`) |
| `kind` | string | Project kind that drives `jac run` dispatch (execute / serve / build). Empty = inferred from the entry-point codespace. One of: `cli`, `cli-native`, `native-binary`, `native-lib`, `service`, `service-mesh`, `py-package`, `js-package`, `web-app`, `web-static`, `desktop`, `mobile` |
| `jac-version` | string | Required Jac compiler version |
| `license` | string | SPDX license identifier (e.g. `"MIT"`) |
| `readme` | string | Path to README file (default: `README.md`) |
| `requires-python` | string | Minimum Python version (e.g. `">=3.12"`) |
| `keywords` | list | Search keywords shown on PyPI |
| `authors` | list of `{name, email}` | Package authors |
| `maintainers` | list of `{name, email}` | Package maintainers |
| `urls` | table | Links shown on PyPI (declared under `[project.urls]`) |

> **Note:** `authors` and `maintainers` also accept a plain string form (`authors = ["Your Name"]`), but the `{ name, email }` table form is recommended -- it is what published packages' `jac.toml` files use and what PyPI renders. See [`[project.include]`](#projectinclude) for controlling which files land in the wheel.

---

### [dependencies]

Python/PyPI packages:

```toml
[dependencies]
requests = ">=2.28.0"
numpy = "1.24.0"
byllm = ">=0.4.8"

[dev-dependencies]
pytest = ">=8.0.0"

[dependencies.git]
my-lib = { git = "https://github.com/user/repo.git", branch = "main" }

[dependencies.system]
git = "*"
ffmpeg = "*"
```

`[dependencies.system]` declares OS (apt) packages your app needs at runtime. On a `jac-scale` Kubernetes deploy they are installed into the service container at startup (Debian only; keys are apt package names). See [System Dependencies](../plugins/jac-scale-kubernetes.md#system-dependencies).

**Version specifiers:**

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Exact | `"1.0.0"` | Exactly 1.0.0 |
| Minimum | `">=1.0.0"` | 1.0.0 or higher |
| Range | `">=1.0,<2.0"` | 1.x only |
| Compatible | `"~=1.4.2"` | 1.4.x |

> **Default behavior:** When you run `jac add requests` without a version, the package is installed unconstrained and then the actual installed version is queried. A compatible-release spec (`~=X.Y`) is recorded -- e.g., if pip installs `2.32.5`, `jac.toml` gets `requests = "~=2.32"`. The `jac update` command also uses this format when writing updated versions back.

---

### [optional-dependencies]

Optional dependency groups that users can install on demand with `jac install --extras <group>`. Useful for heavy or situational dependencies (monitoring, test infrastructure, database drivers) that most users don't need.

```toml
[optional-dependencies.data]
pymongo = ">=4.0,<5.0"
redis = ">=7.0,<8.0"

[optional-dependencies.monitoring]
prometheus-client = ">=0.21.0,<1.0.0"

[optional-dependencies.all]
"mypkg[data,monitoring]" = "*"
```

Install a group at the command line:

```bash
jac install --extras data monitoring
jac install -e . --extras all    # editable install + extras
```

Version specifiers follow the same rules as `[dependencies]`. Use `"*"` or `"latest"` to express no constraint (the package is installed without a version pin).

**Group composition:**

An entry whose name matches `<project-name>[group,...]` is not installed as a package - it expands the listed groups transitively. In the example above, `"mypkg[data,monitoring]" = "*"` under `[optional-dependencies.all]` means `--extras all` pulls in everything from both `data` and `monitoring`.

Third-party extras syntax (e.g. `"testcontainers[mongodb,redis]"`) passes through to pip unchanged.

---

### [run]

Defaults for `jac run`:

```toml
[run]
session = ""            # Session name for persistence
main = true             # Run as main module
cache = true            # Use bytecode cache
topology_index = true   # Build topology index for graph query optimization
diagnostics = "error"   # Diagnostic verbosity: "error", "all", or "none"
```

The `diagnostics` setting controls how compilation errors and warnings are reported during `jac run`:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"error"` | Show errors with full details, suppress warnings, exit code 1 on errors |
| `"all"` | Show both errors and warnings, exit code 1 on errors |
| `"none"` | Suppress all diagnostics, always exit code 0 |

The CLI flag `-e` / `--diagnostics` overrides this setting.

---

### [serve]

Defaults for `jac start`:

```toml
[serve]
port = 8000              # Server port
session = ""             # Session name
main = true              # Run as main module
cl_route_prefix = "cl"   # URL prefix for client apps
base_route_app = ""      # Client app to serve at /

# Optimistic-concurrency policy for concurrent check-then-create races
# (see Persistence -> Concurrent writes).
on_conflict = "retry"        # "retry": abort + replay so the loser converges
                             # "fail":  no replay, return HTTP 409 immediately
conflict_max_attempts = 5    # max walker/function attempts under "retry"
conflict_backoff_ms = 0      # linear backoff between replay attempts (0 = none)
```

`on_conflict` controls what happens when two concurrent requests race a "look it up, create it if missing" against the same node and the loser's commit is rejected. `retry` (default) re-runs the request against the now-current graph so it converges on the winner's node; `fail` surfaces a typed `409 write_conflict` for the client to handle. See [Persistence -> Concurrent writes: check-then-create](../persistence.md#concurrent-writes-check-then-create-and-convergence) for the full model.

---

### [build]

Build configuration:

```toml
[build]
typecheck = false   # Enable type checking
dir = ".jac"        # Build artifacts directory
```

The `dir` setting controls where all build artifacts are stored:

- `.jac/cache/` - Bytecode cache
- `.jac/venv/` - Project virtual environment
- `.jac/client/` - Client-side builds
- `.jac/data/` - Runtime data

---

### [test]

Defaults for `jac test`:

```toml
[test]
directory = ""          # Scopes no-argument `jac test` discovery (empty = walk project root)
filter = ""             # Filter pattern
verbose = false         # Verbose output
fail_fast = false       # Stop on first failure
max_failures = 0        # Max failures (0 = unlimited)
```

When `directory` is set, `jac test` with no file argument collects tests only
from that directory (resolved against the project root), so application modules
whose top-level `with entry` runs on import are not pulled into test collection.

---

### [format]

Defaults for `jac fmt`:

```toml
[format]
outfile = ""        # Output file (empty = in-place)
```

---

### [check]

Defaults for `jac check`:

```toml
[check]
print_errs = true   # Print errors to console
```

#### [check.lint]

Configure which auto-lint rules are active during `jac check --lint` and `jac check --lint --fix`. Rules use a select/ignore model with two group keywords:

- `"default"` - code-transforming rules only (safe, auto-fixable)
- `"all"` - every rule, including unfixable rules like `no-print`

```toml
[check.lint]
select = ["default"]          # Code-transforming rules only (default)
ignore = ["combine-has"]      # Disable specific rules
exclude = []                  # File patterns to skip (glob syntax)
```

To enable all rules including warning-only rules:

```toml
[check.lint]
select = ["all"]              # Everything, including no-print
```

To add specific rules on top of defaults:

```toml
[check.lint]
select = ["default", "no-print"]  # Defaults + no-print warnings
```

To enable only specific rules:

```toml
[check.lint]
select = ["combine-has", "remove-empty-parens"]
```

**Available lint rules:**

| Rule Name | Code | Description | Group |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| `staticmethod-to-static` | `W3001` | Convert `@staticmethod` decorator to `static` keyword | default |
| `combine-has` | `W3002` | Combine consecutive `has` statements with same modifiers | default |
| `combine-glob` | `W3003` | Combine consecutive `glob` statements with same modifiers | default |
| `init-to-can` | `W3004` | Convert `def __init__` / `def __post_init__` to `can init` / `can postinit` | default |
| `remove-empty-parens` | `W3005` | Remove empty parentheses from declarations (`def foo()` → `def foo`) | default |
| `remove-kwesc` | `W3006` | Remove unnecessary backtick escaping from non-keyword names | default |
| `hasattr-to-null-ok` | `W3007` | Convert `hasattr(obj, "attr")` to null-safe access (`obj?.attr`) | default |
| `simplify-ternary` | `W3008` | Simplify `x if x else default` to `x or default` | default |
| `remove-future-annotations` | `W3009` | Remove `import from __future__ { annotations }` (not needed in Jac) | default |
| `fix-impl-signature` | `W3010` | Fix signature mismatches between declarations and implementations | default |
| `remove-import-semi` | `W3011` | Remove trailing semicolons from `import from X { ... }` | default |
| `no-print` | `E3012` | Error on bare `print()` calls (use console abstraction instead) | all |
| `strip-comments` | `W3050` | Remove **all** comments | opt-in |
| `strip-docstrings` | `W3051` | Remove **all** docstrings | opt-in |

Diagnostic codes can be suppressed inline with `# jac:ignore[CODE]` comments. See the full [Errors & Warnings](../diagnostics.md) reference for all diagnostic codes.

**Opt-in (deslop) rules:**

`strip-comments` and `strip-docstrings` are destructive "deslop" rules: they delete content rather than restructure it. Unlike every other rule, they are **never** activated by `select = ["all"]` or `select = ["default"]`; they fire only when named explicitly. A project that wants them on by default lists them alongside its other selections:

```toml
[check.lint]
select = ["default", "strip-comments", "strip-docstrings"]
```

The two are independent, so you can strip comments while keeping docstrings (or vice versa). With a rule selected, `jac fmt --lintfix` removes the content and `jac check` reports it. They are also the rules driving [`jac precommit`](../cli/index.md#jac-precommit) when configured.

**Excluding files from lint:**

Use `exclude` to skip files matching glob patterns:

```toml
[check.lint]
select = ["all"]
exclude = [
    "docs/*",
    "*/examples/*",
    "*/tests/*",
    "legacy_module.jac",
]
```

Patterns are matched against file paths relative to the project root. Use `*` for single-directory wildcards and `**` for recursive matching.

---

### [dot]

Defaults for `jac dot` (graph visualization):

```toml
[dot]
depth = -1          # Traversal depth (-1 = unlimited)
traverse = false    # Traverse connections
bfs = false         # Use BFS (default: DFS)
edge_limit = 512    # Maximum edges
node_limit = 512    # Maximum nodes
format = "dot"      # Output format
```

---

### [cache]

Bytecode cache settings:

```toml
[cache]
enabled = true   # Enable caching
dir = "cache"    # Cache subdirectory under the build dir (i.e. .jac/cache).
                 # An absolute path relocates the cache wholesale.
```

---

### [storage]

!!! note "Scale Configuration"
    The `[storage]` section is provided by the built-in **scale** subsystem (part of `jaclang` core). Its cloud backends (S3/GCS/Azure) require the relevant client libraries in the project venv -- declare the backend in config and run `jac install` to pull them in.

File storage configuration:

```toml
[storage]
storage_type = "local"       # Storage backend (local)
base_path = "./storage"      # Base directory for files
create_dirs = true           # Auto-create directories
```

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `storage_type` | Storage backend type | `"local"` |
| `base_path` | Base directory for file storage | `"./storage"` |
| `create_dirs` | Automatically create directories | `true` |

**Environment Variable Overrides:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `JAC_STORAGE_TYPE` | Storage type (overrides config) |
| `JAC_STORAGE_PATH` | Base directory (overrides config) |
| `JAC_STORAGE_CREATE_DIRS` | Auto-create directories (`"true"`/`"false"`) |

Configuration priority: `jac.toml` > environment variables > defaults.

See [Storage Reference](../plugins/jac-scale-persistence.md#storage) for the full storage API.

---

### Capability settings

Built-in capabilities (byLLM, scale, the client framework) are configured in top-level tables named after the capability:

```toml
# byLLM settings (model identity split from call params)
[byllm.model]
default_model = "gpt-4o"
api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"

[byllm.call_params]
temperature = 0.7

# Server settings (scale)
[scale.server]
port = 8000
host = "0.0.0.0"
docs_enabled = true              # Set to false to disable /docs, /redoc, /openapi.json

# Webhook settings (scale)
[scale.webhook]
secret = "your-webhook-secret-key"
signature_header = "X-Webhook-Signature"
verify_signature = true
api_key_expiry_days = 365

# Kubernetes version pinning (scale) -- scale, byLLM, the MCP server, and the
# client/desktop framework all ship inside the `jac` binary, so they need no
# pinning. Use this only to pin a genuine third-party PyPI plugin for the pod image.
[scale.kubernetes.plugin_versions]
my_plugin = "1.2.3"          # pin a version, or "none" to skip, "latest" to track
```

**Prometheus Metrics (scale):**

```toml
[scale.monitoring]
enabled = true
endpoint = "/metrics"
namespace = "myapp"
walker_metrics = true
```

See [Prometheus Metrics](../plugins/jac-scale-kubernetes.md#prometheus-metrics) for details.

**Kubernetes Secrets (scale):**

```toml
[scale.secrets]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
DATABASE_PASSWORD = "${DB_PASS}"
```

See [Kubernetes Secrets](../plugins/jac-scale-kubernetes.md#kubernetes-secrets) for details.

See also [Scale Webhooks](../plugins/jac-scale-http.md#webhooks) and [Kubernetes Deployment](../plugins/jac-scale-kubernetes.md#kubernetes-deployment) for more options.

**Built-in Local Models (byllm):**

```toml
[byllm.model]
default_model = "local:gemma-4-e4b"   # in-process llama.cpp; no API key, no daemon

[byllm.local]
default_alias  = "gemma-4-e4b"        # used when default_model is unset
n_gpu_layers   = -1                   # -1 = offload all layers to GPU; 0 = CPU only
n_ctx          = 0                    # 0 = use the alias's bundled default
auto_download  = false                # true = skip the first-run TTY prompt
```

Bundled aliases are downloaded as Q4_K_M GGUFs into `~/.cache/jac/models/<alias>/` on first use and managed via `jac model list/pull/rm`. See [Built-in Local Models](../plugins/byllm.md#built-in-local-models) for the full reference and [`jac model`](../cli/index.md#jac-model) for cache management.

**Frontend Framework (jac-client):**

```toml
[client]
framework = "react"   # "react" (default), "solid" (experimental), or "preact"
```

Controls which JavaScript framework the `cl` compiler target emits. The default is `"react"`.

| Value | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `"react"` | Stable | Default. Uses React hooks and `@vitejs/plugin-react`. |
| `"solid"` | Experimental | Uses Solid signals and `vite-plugin-solid`. API may change. |
| `"preact"` | Stable | Drop-in React alternative with a smaller bundle. |

Switching frameworks automatically adjusts the installed npm packages and the generated Vite config; no other changes are needed. Delete your `.jac/client/` build cache after switching so the previous framework's output is not mixed in.

!!! warning "Solid support is experimental"
    The `solid` framework target is under active development. Some jac-client features (error boundaries, suspense slots, advanced routing) may not yet be fully supported. Check the [release notes](../../community/release_notes/jac-client.md) before upgrading.

**Import Path Aliases (jac-client):**

```toml
[client.paths]
"@components/*" = "./components/*"
"@utils/*" = "./utils/*"
"@shared" = "./shared/index"
```

Defines custom import aliases applied to Vite `resolve.alias`, TypeScript `compilerOptions.paths`, and the Jac module resolver. See [jac-client Import Path Aliases](../plugins/jac-client.md#import-path-aliases) for details.

**NPM Registry Configuration (jac-client):**

```toml
[client.npm.scoped_registries]
"@mycompany" = "https://npm.pkg.github.com"

[client.npm.auth."//npm.pkg.github.com/"]
_authToken = "${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}"
```

This generates an `.npmrc` file during dependency installation for private/scoped npm packages. See [jac-client NPM Registry Configuration](../plugins/jac-client.md#npm-registry-configuration) for details.

**Build-Time Constants (jac-client):**

Define global variables that are replaced at compile time in client code via the `[client.vite.define]` section:

```toml
[client.vite.define]
"globalThis.API_URL" = "\"https://api.example.com\""
"globalThis.FEATURE_ENABLED" = true
"globalThis.BUILD_VERSION" = "\"1.2.3\""
```

These values are inlined by Vite during bundling. String values must be double-quoted (JSON-encoded). In client code, access them directly:

```jac
cl {
    def:pub Footer() -> JsxElement {
        return <p>Version: {globalThis.BUILD_VERSION}</p>;
    }
}
```

---

### [scripts]

Custom command shortcuts:

```toml
[scripts]
dev = "jac run main.jac"
test = "jac test -v"
build = "jac build main.jac -t"
lint = "jac check . --lint --fix"
format = "jac fmt ."
```

Run with:

```bash
jac x dev
jac x test
```

---

### [environments]

Environment-specific overrides:

```toml
[environment]
default_profile = "development"

[environments.development]
[environments.development.run]
cache = false
[environments.development.byllm]
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

[environments.production]
inherits = "development"
[environments.production.run]
cache = true
[environments.production.byllm]
model = "gpt-4"
```

Activate a profile:

```bash
JAC_PROFILE=production jac run main.jac
```

---

## Environment Variable Interpolation

Use environment variable interpolation inside `jac.toml` values:

```toml
[byllm.model]
api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"                       # Required
default_model = "${MODEL:-gpt-4o-mini}"             # With default
base_url = "${BASE_URL:?Base URL is required}"      # Required with error
```

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `${VAR}` | Use variable (error if not set) |
| `${VAR:-default}` | Use default if not set |
| `${VAR:?error}` | Custom error if not set |

---

### [project.include]

Controls which files and directories `jac build --as wheel` collects into the wheel.

> **Note:** Earlier releases used a separate `[package]` / `[package.include]` section for publishing metadata. As of jaclang 0.15, `[package]` has been merged into `[project]` -- all publishing fields now live under `[project]` (see above), and file-inclusion rules live under `[project.include]`. Plain `[package]` tables are no longer read.

```toml
[project.include]
# Explicit list of package directories to include.
# Defaults to a directory matching the package name (hyphens replaced with underscores).
packages = ["mylib", "mylib_utils"]

[project.include.data]
# "*" sets global file patterns for all packages.
"*" = ["**/*.jac", "**/*.py", "**/*.pyi", "py.typed"]

# Per-package overrides add extra patterns on top of globals.
mylib = ["**/*.lark", "data/*.json", "templates/**/*"]
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `packages` | Glob list of package directories to ship. Defaults to one directory named after the project (hyphens → underscores). |
| `data` | Map of file-glob patterns. The `"*"` key sets global patterns for every package; a per-package key adds extra patterns on top. |

Simple patterns without a path separator (e.g. `"*.jac"`) are matched recursively, so sub-packages are covered automatically.

**Default included patterns** (when `[project.include.data]` is absent):

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `**/*.jac` | Jac source files |
| `**/*.py` | Python source files |
| `**/*.pyi` | Type stub files |
| `**/*.lark` | Lark grammar files |
| `**/py.typed` | PEP 561 type marker |
| `**/*.jir` | Pre-compiled JIR bytecode (collected if already present -- see [`jac build`](../cli/index.md#jac-build)) |
| `_precompiled/manifest.json` | JIR precompile manifest |

**Always excluded** (regardless of patterns):

- Directories: `.jac/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`, `.git/`, `.hg/`, `node_modules/`, `*.egg-info/`
- File suffixes: `.pyc`

---

### [entrypoints]

Declare console scripts and other entry-point groups. Maps directly to `entry_points.txt` in the wheel's `.dist-info`.

```toml
[entrypoints.scripts]
# Installs a "mylib" CLI command pointing to mylib.cli:main
mylib = "mylib.cli:main"
```

The `[entrypoints.scripts]` group is written as `[console_scripts]` in `entry_points.txt`, which is the standard pip convention for installing CLI commands. After a user runs `pip install mylib`, the `mylib` command is available on their `PATH`.

Any other `[entrypoints.<group>]` table is written through to the wheel metadata verbatim, for consumers that discover packages via `importlib.metadata.entry_points()`. (Jac itself no longer loads any entry-point group at startup -- the former `jac` plugin group is defunct.)

---

## CLI Override

Most settings can be overridden via CLI flags:

```bash
# Override run settings
jac run --no-cache main.jac

# Override test settings
jac test --verbose -x

# Override serve settings
jac start --port 3000
```

---

## .jacignore

The `.jacignore` file controls which Jac files are excluded from compilation and analysis. Place it in the project root.

### Format

One pattern per line, similar to `.gitignore`:

```
# Comments start with #
vite_client_bundle.impl.jac
test_fixtures/
*.generated.jac
```

Each line is a filename or pattern that should be skipped during Jac compilation passes (type checking, formatting, etc.).
